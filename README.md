# Multi-fidelity Airspace and Platform Simulation (MAPS)

MAPS is a collection of simulation Collaboration Tools and Protocols, and 3D Airspace Environments developed in Unity.

MAPS is developed with the intent to enable simulation of large numbers (>103) of drones, and other airspace users, with high spatial fidelity to gain a deep understanding of efficient flow patterns, risk, and robustness. The environment includes agent-based control to enable experiments with both centralised and de-centralised platforms, with each platform having authentic performance simulation such as payload/range, and manoeuvring limits.
